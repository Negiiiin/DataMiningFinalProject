# DataMiningFinalProject

First run the first two cells of the notebook which installs the necessary libraries. Ater running these two cells you need to restart the runtime for the changes to complete.

Make sure to change the directories in the code. the files used in the code are all uploaded with the project.

After that, you can run all the codes.

SUGGESTION: The COMET part of the code takes hours to run, it gets the data needed from the COMET and saves it to COMET_out.csv file. Our suggestion is to skip running that part and just use the result file, COMET_out.csv, which is uploaded.
